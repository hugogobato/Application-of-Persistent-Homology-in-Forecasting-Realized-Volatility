Forecasting Realized Volatility

# Abstract

This paper proposes a novel algorithm coined as Persistent Homology for Realized Volatility (PH-RV) that has the aim of effectively employing persistent homology (PH) in neural network models to increase their forecast accuracy in predicting realized volatility (RV). This paper also proposes a novel neural network model for multi-step forecasting that systematically yields statistically more accurate forecasts than other forecasting models. The proposed model coined as NBEATSx-VP utilizes neural basis expansion analysis with exogenous variables (NBEATSx) network, and VIX close prices and 2-d Wasserstein distances of stock returns  as exogenous variables. While considering Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), NBEATSx-VP produces at least 9% more precise forecasts than benchmark models, NBEATSx-VP achieves at least 13% more accurate forecasts than state-of-the-art models regarding Quasi-likelihood (QLIKE).
